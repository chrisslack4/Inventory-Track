# Overview

With this software my goal was to learn C# by creating a catelog program that would help companies store and track data about products they supply.

With it you are able to Enter new products, change product details, and lookup(search) for product details.

Though in my video example I use car parts to indicate its effectiveness, with slight modifaction I can have it work for keeping track of my pantry items so I can know when to replace them.

Follow the link below to youtube and watch my video demonstrating this code.

# Development Environment

For this project I used Microsoft, Geek for Geeks and w3 school websites to answer questions and learn the basic syntax and programing language of C#. I also used google and stack overflow when I got specific debugging errors.

For this project I used C#. Though  simular in many ways to C++ I found C# seems to be more simple and intuitive to learn.
